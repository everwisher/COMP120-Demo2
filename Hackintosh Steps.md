To build a hackintosh, we basically need to:

1. Build a machine with Pear-like models of hardware: Intel CPUs, AMD Polaris/Navi Graphics Card, Broadcom Wi-Fi & Bluetooth combo chipset, etc.
1. Get a bootloader for macOS: Clover bootloader or OpenCore bootloader.
1. Get a macOS latest version installer and burn it to a flash drive using a real Macintosh.
1. Fine-tune the config.plist file.
1. Startup and install the OS
1. Spoof the system and pretend to be a real Macintosh.
